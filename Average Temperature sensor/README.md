# Define an Average Temperature sensor in Home Assistant

This Home Assistant template sensor, **`zg_average_temperature`**, calculates the average temperature for a specified area (in this case, the living area). 
The benefit of an average temperature sensor is not only to measure a large area with more sensors, but also to create redundancy: infact, if a sensor is not available, you can use others to ensure the continuity of the automations based on that sensors (my heating system `climate` entity is based on this).
You can do the same with other numeric sensors, like humidity, pressure, and so on.
Here's how it works:

1. **Data Source**:  
   - The sensor pulls data from a predefined list of temperature sensors instead of a group (like I did in other examples):  
     `sensor.temperatura_soggiorno_temperature`, `sensor.temperatura_cucina_temperature`, `sensor.mi_air_purifier_3_3h_temperature`, and `sensor.temperatura_soggiorno_2_temperature`.

3. **Filtering Valid Sensors**:  
   - It excludes sensors with states like `unavailable`, `unknown`, or `none`.
   - The remaining sensors are converted to floating-point numbers for accurate calculations.

4. **Average Calculation**:  
   - If at least one valid sensor remains, it calculates the average temperature by summing the valid readings and dividing by their count, rounding the result to one decimal place.
   - If no valid sensors are available, it reports the state as `unavailable`.

```yaml
- platform: template
  sensors:
    zg_average_temperature:
      friendly_name: "Living Area Average Temperature"
      unit_of_measurement: "Â°C"
      value_template: >-
        {%- set sensors = ['sensor.temperatura_soggiorno_temperature', 'sensor.temperatura_cucina_temperature', 'sensor.mi_air_purifier_3_3h_temperature', 'sensor.temperatura_soggiorno_2_temperature'] -%}
        {%- set active_sensors = states|rejectattr('state','in',['unavailable','unknown','none']) | selectattr('entity_id', 'in', sensors) | map(attribute='state') | map('float') | list -%}
        {%- set active_count = active_sensors | count -%}
        {%- if active_count > 0 -%}
          {%- set average = active_sensors | sum / active_count-%}
          {{ average|round(1) }}
        {%- else -%}
          unavailable
        {%- endif -%}
```
